# transport-portal
A Python / Flask webportal for transport companies. Used for managing vehicles, employees, creating timesheets, and setting up automatic SMS and email notifications when license plates or drivers licenses are about to expire.

Created for KPM Transport and its partners. Tuned for the norwegian transport market, and configured to accord with norwegian law. Probably not suitable for any other company without massive changes, although you are welcome to try.
